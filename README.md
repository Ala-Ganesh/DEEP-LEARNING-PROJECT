Description:

This project involves building and deploying a Deep Learning-based Image Classification System that can accurately classify images into predefined categories. Deep Learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), uses neural networks to learn complex patterns from large datasets, making it ideal for tasks like image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding.

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. The system aims to achieve high accuracy in classifying images and provide real-time predictions via a simple web interface or API.

Methodology

Data Collection & Preprocessing

A labeled dataset is collected from publicly available sources such as Kaggle or ImageNet.

Data is preprocessed by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.

Augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied to improve generalization.

Model Development

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is designed using TensorFlow/Keras.

Layers include convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.

The model is compiled with an appropriate optimizer (Adam/SGD) and loss function (categorical crossentropy).

Model Training & Evaluation

The CNN model is trained on the training dataset and validated on a separate validation set.

Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.

Techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling are used to optimize training.

Deployment

A lightweight web application is built using Flask or FastAPI to serve the trained model.

Users can upload an image through the web interface and receive predictions instantly.

The application is hosted locally via Google Colab with ngrok or deployed on cloud platforms for public access.

Key Features

End-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing to deployment.

User-friendly interface for uploading and classifying images.

Use of deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy.

Expected Outcomes

A fully functional deep learning model capable of classifying images with high accuracy.

A deployed API or web application for real-time inference.

Insights into deep learning model training, optimization, and deployment.
